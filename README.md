# Summary

This code belongs to `blog.nagakonada.com`.

It uses Gatsby, Bootstrap and Markdown to write my posts.

Using the power of Gatsby, for each blog post, I create a new markdown file,
generate the static biuld (Gatsby thrives at that) and deploy that to Netlify.
Actually, netlify does that for me automatically whenever I push something to this `main` branch.
